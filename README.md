# noto-emoji

Google has provided the Noto Emoji font, which can be found at https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji. However, sometimes Google updates the font, causing the SHA256 hash of the file to change. This can make it difficult to use in situations where a fixed hash is required, such as in NixOS. To work around this issue, I have uploaded the font to this repository.
